## THE SHORT VERSION

The **Music Open Source** Project is dedicated to providing a brief guide for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, 
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other volunteers.

Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

## THE LONGER VERSION

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the organizers may take any action they seem appropriate.
